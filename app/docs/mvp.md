# Shopify Multi-Product Configurator - MVP Development Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a Shopify app for merchant shops that allows configuring multiple products simultaneously (variant, text, color) and adding them to cart with a single AJAX click - without page reload.

**Approach**: Keep it minimal with only 3 fixed product slots, no dynamic adding, no live preview.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Remix (SSR, `useFetcher` / `action()`)
- **UI**: Shopify Polaris (Cards, Select, TextField, Button)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Polaris CSS (no Tailwind)
